            Article 10. Confidentiality and personal data
              
            Personal data concerning the Members are stored by Tell NP Advisers on its servers, to be processed as part of the use of the Service. 
            
            Tell NP Advisers processes Members’ personal data, which it has gathered in accordance with the “Safe Harbor Provisions” proposed by the Federal Trade Commission and by the European Union, to which it subscribes. 
            
            Tell NP Advisers invites Members to read its Privacy Policy. 
            
            All personal data provided by a Member when using the Site and Service are collected legally and fairly. Their purpose is the use of the Site and the provision of the Service, and they may therefore be used by Tell NP Advisers to this end. 
            
            Specifically, each Member is informed of the fact that the data concerning him/her may be used by Tell NP Advisers to offer him/her the opportunity of contacting other Members, selected in function of said data, which are not communicated to such Members, other than those accessible through the public profile, and are therefore used for this purpose exclusively by Tell NP Advisers. Each Member accepts this use of his/her data. 
            
            The Registration Form found on the Site allows the Member to subscribe to the Site and Service by revealing to Tell NP Advisers certain personal data concerning him/her. 
            
            The mandatory or optional nature of the communication of the requested data is mentioned on the Form for each field. Where the communication of the data is mandatory, failure to disclose it will result in the Member’s registration application not being processed. 
            
            Tell NP Advisers does not communicate the personnal data of Members to third parties, except for the data found on each Member's public profile, in accordance with the Member's determined parameterization and to the purpose of the Site and Service, and of those cases where the communication of such data is required by applicable laws, particularly at the request of the legal authorities. 
            
            Personal data communicated by the Member will be destroyed five years after his/her last connection to the Site or upon the expiration of the Contract, at his/her explicit request. 
            
            Members have the right to access, rectify and delete personal data concerning them and processed over the Site, and oppose their communication to third parties for justifiable cause. 
            
            Members may exercise these rights by writing to the following electronic address: contact@tell-np.com or to the following postal address: Tell NP Advisers, c/o Berdat & Cie, Rue du Cendrier 24, 1201 Geneva, Switzerland.  
            
            The Site uses “cookie” technology. Cookies are especially useful to facilitate the personalization of the Member’s access to the Service. Specifically, the Site contains a connection cookie allowing Members who so wish to access the Site repeatedly without having to identify themselves each time. To do so, the Member must tick the checkbox corresponding to “Keep me logged in”, found in the “Log in” window which appears when a new connection to the Site is made. By clicking it, Members activate this cookie, which lasts three months, and may thereafter access the Site repeatedly during this time without having to identify themselves. Members are hereby informed that, in this case, other users of their computers may access their profile’s management interface and account, since prior authentication is no longer required. 
            
            Generally, cookies are harmless to the Member’s computer. The Member may accept or refuse the cookies by configuring his/her browser. The cookies are anonymous and under no circumstance do they gather any personal data; the only data collected are for connection and statistical use. 
            
            Tell NP Advisers keeps track, through these cookies, of connections to the Site, and specifically of their origin. This use is made for statistical-analysis purposes, and the data are destroyed thereafter. 
            
            Tell NP Advisers takes the necessary precautions to ensure that personal data gathered through the Site are not lost, leaked, consulted, modified, or revealed to unauthorised third parties. 
            
            Members may access their personal data upon simple request by writing to the following electronic address:  contact@tell-np.com, or to the following postal address: Tell NP Advisers, c/o Berdat & Cie, Rue du Cendrier 24, 1201 Geneva, Switzerland. 
            
            However, this access may be refused where the law allows such a decision.
            
            Article 11. Intellectual Property

Article 5.2 hereunder). 
            
            Acceptance of these Terms of Use shall be deemed the Member’s acknowledgement of Tell NP Advisers’ aforementioned intellectual property rights and his/her commitment to respect them.

Therefore, each Member allows other Members to consult his/her personal data thus made available through his/her profile and to use them to contact him/her. He/she explicitly accepts this use of his/her profile, which goes to the very essence of the Site and Service. 
            
            Solely for the ends of providing the Service, Members allow Tell NP Advisers to reproduce, represent, adapt and translate the contents and data provided by them over the Site, under the conditions defined hereunder:

            Tell NP Advisers is allowed to adapt and translate Members’ contents, as well as to reproduce these adaptations on any digital support, current or future, stipulated above, in order to provide the Service, particularly in different languages.

            This license is granted for the entire world and for the duration of the Contract binding the Member to Tell NP Advisers. 
            
            Should a manifest violation of intellectual property rights be committed on the Site, the person interested in protecting his/her rights is invited to notify Tell NP Advisers of such a violation, as specifically as possible, by sending an email to contact@tell-np.com.
